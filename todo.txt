            - A viewport manager: handles windowing, framebuffer, etc
            - A primitives manager: handles primitives like lines, filling, etc
    Load from .obj file
    Triangularization of surface
    Other filling algorithms
    Antialiased Filling
    Z-buffering
    Vectors have 4th component
