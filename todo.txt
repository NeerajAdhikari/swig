TODO
Manage the plotting abstractions:
    - Unform interface for the renderer - done
    - Separation to two levels:
    - A viewport manager: handles windowing, framebuffer, etc
    - A primitives manager: handles primitives like lines, filling, etc
Other filling algorithms
Antialiased Filling
Object clipping

Load vertex normao
Manage object information (Point normals, Point color, Surface normals)
Selection of shading algorithm
Selection of object type (bounded/nonbounded)
Add distance Falloff (through depth map)
Shadow
May include directional light
