Manage the plotting abstractions:
    - Unform interface for the renderer - done
    - Separation to two levels:
    - A viewport manager: handles windowing, framebuffer, etc
    - A primitives manager: handles primitives like lines, filling, etc
Other filling algorithms
Antialiased Filling
Object clipping

Load vertex normal
Manage object information (Point normals, Point color, Surface normals)
Distance Consideration in lighting ( currently all sources are infinitely far )
Add distance Falloff
Selection of shading algorithm
Selection of object type (bounded/nonbounded)
Shadow
